# TaskWeave Scripts

This folder contains utility scripts for development and deployment.

**Note:** Most scripts in this folder are excluded from Git (see `.gitignore`). These are local development utilities that are not part of the core application.

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `backend/env.example` to `backend/.env`
2. Fill in your API keys (OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic, etc.)
3. Never commit `.env` files!
